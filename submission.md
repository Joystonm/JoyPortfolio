# Joy Portfolio - Interactive Studio Experience

## What I Learned

Building this sci-fi themed portfolio deepened my understanding of modern React development, particularly custom hooks for scroll detection and state management. I mastered advanced animation techniques using Framer Motion and GSAP for smooth transitions and scroll-triggered effects. The project taught me mobile-first responsive design principles, implementing touch-optimized interactions and performance considerations for different devices. I also learned glassmorphism CSS techniques, utility-first styling with Tailwind, and how to balance visual appeal with performance optimization by reducing animations on mobile devices while maintaining an immersive user experience.
